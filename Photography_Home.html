	    <h3>Defination Of MP</h3>
	   <p>A megapixel, often shortened to MP, is equal to 1 million pixels. A pixel is an individual element of a digital image. The number of megapixels determines the resolution of an image, and a digital image with more megapixels has more resolution. A higher resolution is certainly desirable in a digital photograph, as it means the camera uses more pixels to create the image, which should allow for greater accuracy.</p></div>

	   <h3>What is ISO? </h3>
	   <p>The name stands for International Organization for Standardization. I know this doesnâ€™t offer much help. We need to look back at photographic history a little bit first.</p>
	   <p>So, as we saw, ISO is just a way to classify your film speed and how sensitive to light the film is. They are usually in the range of 50, 100, 200, 400, 800, 1600 and 3200. There are other films that are outside this range, but they are more specialized.</p>

	   <h3>What is HDR?</h3>
	   <p>High Dynamic Range (HDR) is a technology that produces images with a large perceptible difference between bright and dark regions. This capability achieves lifelike images and preserves precise details in lighting variations and gradations for realistically bright or dark pictures without subtle detail loss.</p>
	   <p>HDR monitors produce realistic picture quality to replicate original images. With this new dynamic range compressing technology, an HDR display fully samples bright-dark tone variation within a scene to avoid overexposure of bright images as well as prevent lost details in dark images. In addition, HDR monitors represent true colors, unlike conventional SDR displays. </p>
