		  <li>
		   <h3>LIGHTING</h3>
    		 <p>Even the most expensive camera is worthless inside a completely dark room. We've come a long way from the first room-sized cameras, the essence of photography has remained the same: light. Whether you are shooting film or digital, you cannot shoot anything without light.</p>
		  </li>
		  <li>
		   <h3>POST PROCESSING</h3>
    		 <p>Opening Photoshop for the first time is like cracking open a fantasy novel that opens up an entirely new world of strange creatures, opposite natural laws and a completely new language. That new fantasy world is bursting with exciting possibilities, yet bogged down by so many unknowns.</p>
		  </li>
		  <li>
		   <h3>WHAT IS APERTURE?</h3>
    		 <p>Beginner photographers are often intimidated by the term exposure triangle, and think that they missed a lesson in geometry class. But the 3 components of this triangle - aperture, ISO and shutter speed - are key when learning about the technique and composition of an image.</p>
		  </li>
		  <li>
		   <h3>EXPOSURE BRACKETING</h3>
    		 <p>One of the hardest things to perfect in a photo is the exposure, as there are many pieces to bring together for the perfect image. Exposure bracketing allows you to take 3 images at 3 different exposures which gives you the security of knowing that one of them will have captured the light in the best possible way.</p>
		  </li>
		   <li>
		   <h3>CREATING BOKEH BACKGROUNDS</h3>
    		 <p>Sure, a good photograph is all about the subject — but what about the background? What’s behind the subject (and what’s in front) can either give a detailed sense of the scene, or put more emphasis on the subject by blurring the distractions into dreamy shapes and colors known as bokeh.</p>
		  </li>
		  <li>
		   <h3>WHAT IS CAMERA RAW</h3>
    		 <p>Every new photographer feels the same confusion when hearing about the differences between shooting images in RAW vs. JPEG (or JPG). In the past, most photographers used JPEG because you could get more images on your memory cards and the photos looked good.</p>
