		 <p>Imagine you’re back in that completely dark room — but now you light a candle. Where that candle is in relation to the object you are shooting plays a dramatic role on the overall look of the final image. In photography, sometimes you can move that light source, and other times you have to move the subject to alter the position of the light.
</p>
<p><b>Front lighting</b>, or placing the subject so that light is directly in front of the person or object, brings out the detail. Why? With the light directly in the front, the shadows fall behind the object, so there aren’t any shadows in the image to conceal any details. Front lighting is the simplest to shoot, however, it sometimes looks rather flat or boring.
</p>
<p><b>Side lighting</b>, or placing the light source or the subject so that the light hits from the side, fights the boring look of front lighting by creating shadows and depth. Side lighting is still fairly simple to shoot — you just have to careful and watch how the shadows fall. Side lighting doesn’t have to be at a 90 degree angle and even minor adjustments can change the way the shadows fall. When shooting with lighting from the side, watch where the shadows fall — small adjustments in the subject’s position can create more interesting or flattering shadows.</p>
        </p>

		 <b>Back lighting</b> is the trickiest of the bunch — proceed with caution. Without a light modifier or the understanding of manual mode, you’ll end up with a silhouette. Beginners are often best to avoid backlighting scenarios, like when you place the subject directly in front of a window. Don’t ignore it for too long however — once you’re comfortable in manual mode, backlighting can create spectacular images. When backlight, many things appear to glow — leaves and flowers, for example. Backlighting also gives portraits a nice pop and almost a halo effect.
		 
		With the light hitting the subject from behind, all of the light’s shadows are in the front of the subject, which turns the subject into a dark silhouette. Using manual modes, however, you can adjust the exposure so that the subject will be properly exposed. That will leave the background overexposed, but that sometimes creates a neat effect, like this:

	     <h3>PHOTOGRAPHY LIGHTING BASICS: SOFT LIGHT VS. HARD LIGHT</h3>
		  <p>Changing the position of the light source in relation to the subject changes where the shadows fall, but just how light or dark are those shadows? That’s where the light source, and any light modifiers, come into play.

A hard light source produces shadows with minimal transition between the light and dark areas of the image. While hard light refers to the transition between light and dark and not how deep the shadows are, hard light is often (but not always) associated with creating deeper, darker shadows. Hard light gets a bad rep — used incorrectly, hard light will create dark shadows under the eyes in a portrait, for example. But, hard light tends to create more contrast in an image. Hard light can be combined with the position of the light to avoid shadowy eyes and create drama inside a portrait.

Soft light, on the other hand, has a much more subtle transition between the light and dark areas of the image. Shooting with soft light has less drama, but the smoother shadows prevent details from being lost in the dark areas of the image.</div>
